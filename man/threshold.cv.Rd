\title{Select Tuning Parameter for Thresholding Covariance Matrix by CV}
\usage{
threshold.cv(matrix, method = "hard", thresh.len = 20, n.cv = 10,
  norm = "F", seed = 142857)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{a N*p matrix, N indicates sample size
and p indicates the dimension}

\item{method}{thresholding method, "hard" or "soft"}

\item{thresh.len}{the number of thresholding values tested in
cross-validation, the thresholding values will be a sequence of
\code{thresh.len} equally spaced values from minimum threshold constant
to largest covariance in sample covariance matrix}

\item{n.cv}{times that cross-validation repeated, the default number is 10}

\item{norm}{the norms used to measure the cross-validation errors,
which can be the Frobenius norm "F" or the operator norm "O"}

\item{seed}{random seed, the default value is 142857}
}
\value{
An object of class "CovCv" containing the cross-validation's result
  for covariance matrix regularization, including:
  \item{regularization}{regularization method, which is "Hard Thresholding"
    or "Soft Thresholding"}
  \item{parameter.opt}{selected optimal parameter by cross-validation}
  \item{cv.error}{the corresponding cross-validation errors}
  \item{n.cv}{times that cross-validation repeated}
  \item{norm}{the norm used to measure the cross-validation error}
  \item{seed}{random seed}
  \item{threshold.grid}{thresholding values tested in cross-validation}
}
\description{
Apply K-fold cross-validation for selecting tuning parameters for
thresholding covariance matrix using grid search strategy
}
\details{
For cross-validation, this function split the sample randomly into
two pieces of size n1 = n-n/log(n) and n2 = n/log(n), and repeat this k times
