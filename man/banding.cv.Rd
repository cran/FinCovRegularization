\title{Select Tuning Parameter for Banding Covariance Matrix by CV}
\usage{
banding.cv(matrix, n.cv = 10, norm = "F", seed = 142857)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{a N*p matrix, N indicates sample size
and p indicates the dimension}

\item{n.cv}{times that cross-validation repeated, the default number is 10}

\item{norm}{the norms used to measure the cross-validation errors,
which can be the Frobenius norm "F" or the operator norm "O"}

\item{seed}{random seed, the default value is 142857}
}
\value{
An object of class "CovCv" containing the cross-validation's result
  for covariance matrix regularization, including:
  \item{regularization}{regularization method, which is "Banding"}
  \item{parameter.opt}{selected optimal parameter by cross-validation}
  \item{cv.error}{the corresponding cross-validation errors}
  \item{n.cv}{times that cross-validation repeated}
  \item{norm}{the norm used to measure the cross-validation error}
  \item{seed}{random seed}
}
\description{
Apply K-fold cross-validation for selecting tuning parameters for
banding covariance matrix using grid search strategy
}
\details{
For cross-validation, this function split the sample randomly into
two pieces of size n1 = n-n/log(n) and n2 = n/log(n), and repeat this k times
