\title{FinCovRegularization: Covariance Matrix Estimation and Regularization 
  for Finance}
\description{
Estimation and regularization for covariance matrix of asset returns. 
For covariance matrix estimation, three major types of factor models are 
included: macroeconomic factor model, fundamental factor model and 
statistical factor model. For covariance matrix regularization, 
four regularized estimators are included: banding, tapering, 
hard-thresholding and soft-thresholding. The tuning parameters of these 
regularized estimators are selected via cross-validation.
